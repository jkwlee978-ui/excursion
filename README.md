#Codecademy Project: Excursion
> In this project, we create a web page which advertises a product called “Excursion.”
> We use growing toolset including HTML, CSS, Command Line Interface, Git, and GitHub.
> The web page we’ll build advertises a mobile app which helps users record and share their experiences,
> so we’ll use video and landscape imagery to set the scene.
> A landing page is a vital tool in marketing a product these days, and the goal will be to entice potential customers
> into using the product.
